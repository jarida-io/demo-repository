# Jarida Open Source

**Jarida** is an open-source community co-managed by [Liz Wangui (@kui29)](https://github.com/kui29) and [Jerry Ochieng (@JERRYFROMKENYA)](https://github.com/JERRYFROMKENYA).  
We provide **solutions to global problems**, with a primary focus on **Africa**, while empowering African talent to grow, collaborate, and gain recognition worldwide.

Our inaugural open-source product is the **Kenyan Sign Language Translator** — the first of many impactful projects to come.
